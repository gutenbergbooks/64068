</div>

<p class='c006'>The Mineral Resources Committee of the Imperial Institute
has arranged for the issue of this series of Monographs on
Mineral Resources in amplification and extension of those
which have appeared in the <cite>Bulletin of the Imperial Institute</cite>
during the past fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Monographs are prepared either by members of the
Scientific and Technical Staff of the Imperial Institute, or by
external contributors, to whom have been available the
statistical and other special information relating to mineral
resources collected and arranged at the Imperial Institute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object of these Monographs is to give a general account
of the occurrences and commercial utilisation of the more
important minerals, particularly in the British Empire. No
attempt has been made to give details of mining or metallurgical
processes.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> PLATINUM METALS: THEIR OCCURRENCES, CHARACTERS AND USES</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Introduction</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The metals which comprise the Platinum group are the following:
Platinum, Palladium, Iridium, Osmium, Ruthenium
and Rhodium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to the year 1914 Russia produced over 90 per cent. of
the world’s supply of platinum, the Republic of Colombia,
South America, ranking next in importance with about 5 per
cent. Owing, however, to the war and to the chaotic conditions
brought about by the revolution, the output of Russia
has considerably decreased, and although the Colombian production
has been steadily increasing, the increased demand
in connection with munition manufacture caused a somewhat
serious shortage during the latter stages of the war, which was
especially felt in the United States. As a result much exploratory
work has recently been carried on in an endeavour
to discover new deposits of importance; but up to the present,
although several fresh occurrences have been brought to light,
results have on the whole been disappointing.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Occurrences</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Platinum usually occurs in nature as native metal alloyed
with one or more of its allied metals in the form of very fine
grains more or less flattened; sometimes in the form of irregular
nuggets; and occasionally, though rarely, in small cubic
crystals. It is sometimes coated with a black layer of iron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>oxide, which may be magnetic, in which case it is not easily
recognizable. When unrefined it is referred to as “crude”
platinum.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the exception of a certain amount of the platinum
metals, obtained from the refining of copper and gold bullion,
particularly from the copper-nickel deposits of Sudbury,
Ontario, about 99 per cent. of the whole supply is derived from
alluvial deposits. Several occurrences of platinum <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> are
known, but so far few are of commercial importance: however,
in view of the indications of exhaustion shown by some of the
placer deposits, notably in Russia, the exploration of primary
ores is now receiving more attention and practical results have
already been achieved in Russia and in Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mother rocks from which the deposits are derived, in
the large majority of known cases, consist of basic and ultra-basic
igneous rocks, including peridotites, pyroxenites and
dunites. The two first are composed of iron magnesian silicates,
pyroxene, augite and hornblende with olivine, chromite,
ilmenite and magnetite: the dunites consist principally of
olivine with some chromite. These rocks are often found to
have undergone more or less alteration to serpentine. In
addition, platinum has been found in quartz veins, notably at
the Boss Mine, Nevada, and in a few known cases it has been
derived from formations in schistose, or altered sedimentary
rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>When present in serpentine, platinum is usually disseminated
through the rock in fine particles. It seldom occurs in a lode-formation. In sedimentary rocks it usually occurs in sandstones.
In cases where alluvial deposits have been derived
from the basic igneous rocks, the associated minerals are usually
chromite, magnetite, ilmenite, iridium and osmiridium. In
sedimentary deposits the metal is commonly associated with
quartz, copper, nickel, silver and palladium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum has been found in certain varieties of the copper
ores tetrahedrite and bournonite. It has occasionally been
located in shales and in coal, although not in recoverable
quantities. In the latter case, in an Australian coal, it is
associated with vanadium<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> p. 992.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several cases are known of platinum being present in meteorites,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>two well-authenticated instances having been reported
from Mexico. Platinum has been shown to exist in meteoric
iron from New South Wales.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crude platinum, as recovered, contains from 70 to 90 per
cent. of the metal, and, as mentioned above, is really an alloy
of platinum with one or more of the allied metals, the chief
impurities consisting principally of iron and copper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The table on the next page gives the analyses of typical
samples of crude platinum from the Urals, California, British
Columbia, and other places.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum also occurs in combination with arsenic in the
mineral <i>Sperrylite</i> (PtAs<sub>2</sub>), in the form of minute octahedral
crystals. The colour of this mineral is tin white, its lustre is
metallic and brilliant, its hardness varies from 6 to 7, and its
specific gravity is 10·6. The mineral is brittle and breaks
with a conchoidal fracture. It is very rare, and is interesting
as being the only mineral of platinum known
besides the native metal.  It occurs associated with sulphide
minerals of magmatic origin in gabbros and diabases, notably
in the nickeliferous pyrites of Sudbury, Canada, and in the
copper ores of the Rambler Mine, Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that the palladium, which is also found in
these deposits, is similarly present in the form of an arsenide,
but such a mineral has not yet been definitely proved to exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is an analysis of a sample of sperrylite:
platinum, 54·47 per cent.; rhodium, 0·76 per cent.; palladium,
trace; arsenic, 42·23 per cent.; antimony, 0·54 per cent.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> p. 69.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Properties of the Platinum Metals</span></h3>

<p class='c015'><i>Platinum.</i>—The colour is white with a greyish tinge. When
pure it is very malleable and ductile. Its coefficient of expansion
is less than that of all other metals. Platinum fuses
at about 1750° C., but the presence of impurities lowers the
melting-point. Its specific gravity is 21·5, and its hardness
is from 4 to 5. Its electric conductivity is low, being 13·4
at 0° C.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> p. 398.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Platinum is not acted upon by either nitric, sulphuric or
hydrochloric acid, but is soluble in aqua regia (1 part of nitric
to 2 parts of hydrochloric acid), or in other mixtures liberating
chlorine, with the formation of platinum tetrachloride
(PtCl<sub>4</sub>). It is not acted upon by air or moisture, even at high
temperatures. It is corroded by caustic alkalis, sulphides,
sulphates, phosphates and arsenides, if heated in contact
with them. It will not amalgamate with mercury unless
sodium is present, in this respect differing from gold and
silver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum, in a finely-divided condition, absorbs large
quantities of hydrogen or other gases, which on occlusion
become more active: hence its value as a catalytic agent.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Palladium.</i>—This metal resembles platinum, but is sometimes
fibrous, the colour being between that of platinum and
of silver. It possesses a lower melting-point than platinum—about
1550° C. It is malleable, has a hardness of from 4·5
to 5, and a specific gravity of 11·5. As already stated, palladium,
when found in copper ores, is probably present in
combination with arsenic. <i>Porpezite</i>, a rare mineral, containing
gold and up to 10 per cent. palladium, has been identified in
gold-bearing veins in Brazil [see p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>].</p>

<p class='c007'>Palladium is produced from the refining of copper matte
and of base gold bullion from Australia and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Iridium</i> is a brilliant white brittle metal, with a specific
gravity of 22·4, and hardness of 6 to 7. Its fusion point is
very high—about 2200° C.—and under ordinary conditions it
is not attacked by any acid. At 1100° C. it begins to oxidize
to a purple oxide. Iridium usually occurs either in crude
platinum, or alloyed with osmium, as iridosmine, or as native
metal. The bulk of iridium is derived from the platinum
placer deposits of the Urals, but the Californian metal is more
valuable, on account of its better quality. It is also obtained
in small amounts from copper bullion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Osmium</i> is a hard and brittle metal, bluish-grey in colour.
Its specific gravity is 22·5, and it has a very high melting-point,
in this respect being the most refractory of the group.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Iridosmine</i>, or <i>Osmiridium</i>, an alloy of iridium and osmium,
occurs as hexagonal crystals, or flattened grains of lighter
colour than platinum. It may contain from 40 to 77 per cent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of iridium, and from 20 to 50 per cent. of osmium. If the
iridium predominates, the alloy is called <i>Nevyanskite</i>, and
<i>Siserskite</i> if the osmium content is high. It is distinguishable
from platinum by the brittleness of the flakes. Siserskite
gives off a pungent odour, if strongly heated, caused by the
volatilization of osmium. Iridosmine has a hardness of 6 to 7,
and a specific gravity of 19 to 21.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Ruthenium</i> is a white metal, with a specific gravity of 12·1.
It is scarcely acted upon by aqua regia. Ruthenium occurs
mainly in small amounts in iridosmine. It is also found in
the copper ores of Sudbury and other places. <i>Laurite</i> is a
very rare sulphide of ruthenium (RuS<sub>2</sub>), containing a small
amount of osmium, which has only been recognized in the
Borneo deposits.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rhodium</i> is a white metal resembling aluminium, with a
specific gravity of 12·1, and a melting-point of about 2000° C.
It is ductile and malleable at red heat. In addition to its
occurrence in crude platinum, the metal is also contained in
small quantities in the sperrylite found in the copper ores of
Sudbury, Canada<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a> p. 779.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloidal Platinum.</i>—This has only recently been detected
in ores, and therefore its occurrence might not be detected
qualitatively. By destroying its colloidal condition, however,
its presence can be discovered in the ordinary ways<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Metallurgical Treatment</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Crude platinum can be refined either by dry or by wet methods,
the following being brief outlines of the two processes:</p>

<p class='c007'>By the wet method, the crude platinum is dissolved in
aqua regia, with excess of hydrochloric acid. Evaporation
is continued until the whole of the nitric acid is expelled.
By addition of a solution of ammonium chloride, the platinum
is then precipitated as ammonium platini-chloride. This
precipitate is heated to redness, when chlorine and ammonium
chloride are given off, and spongy platinum remains. The
last is next granulated, after fusion by the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe
in a small lime furnace. Platinum obtained by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>method may contain small amounts of iridium, rhodium and
palladium.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dry method, introduced by Delville and Debray, the
crude platinum is smelted with galena in a small reverberatory
furnace. A portion of the lead is reduced to the metallic
state by the iron in the charge, and forms a fusible alloy with
the platinum. The osmiridium present settles to the bottom
of the furnace, and may thus be removed. Litharge is then
thrown in to form more alloy, and some glass to act as a flux.
The alloy is cupelled, and the residual platinum is then melted
in a lime furnace with the oxy-hydrogen flame. The
platinum thus obtained often contains iridium and rhodium.</p>

<p class='c007'>A combination of these two methods is also sometimes
employed<a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> p. 403.</p>

<p class='c007'>The electrolytic process of gold-refining was introduced to
treat platiniferous gold. In the gold chloride, or Wohlwill
method, iridium and osmiridium are insoluble, and remain
with the anode slime. Platinum and palladium, if nearly
pure, are also insoluble, but when present alloyed with gold
and silver, pass into the solution and remain there. In a
hot bath it is stated that the platinum present should not
exceed 50 gm. per litre. According to T. K. Rose, a cold
bath containing only 20 gm. per litre causes a certain quantity
of platinum to be deposited with the gold<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>H. F. Keller, in “Platinum, the Most Precious of Metals”
(<cite>Journal of the Franklin Institute</cite>, November 1912) deals fully
with the extraction and refining of platinum.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Platinum-Refining Agencies</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The following contains a list of the principal firms engaged
in the refining of platinum metals:</p>

<p class='c006'>In England: Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co., Ltd., Lees &amp; Sanders,
Warstone Smelting Works, Sheffield Smelting Works, Johnson
&amp; Sons. (This is the list of the Ministry of Munitions.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In France: Legende et Cie., Compagnie Internationale du
Platine, Lyon Allemand, Lecht Lyonnais, Henrique Marrett,
Bonnen, Hesse Fils.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>In Germany: W. C. Heraeus, G. Siebert, F. Eisennad

&amp; Lehrfeld, Roessler &amp; Hasslacher Chemical Co.,
Wildberg Bros., and others handling scrap.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Russian information about 25 per cent. of the
Russian output before the war was refined in Germany. In
Russia there are practically no platinum-refining facilities<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Uses of Platinum and its Allies</span></h3>

<p class='c015'><i>Platinum.</i>—In the chemical industry platinum is largely
used for catalyzers in the manufacture of sulphuric, acetic
and nitric acids; for stills for the final concentration of sulphuric
acid; and in the electro-chemical industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the making of “contact” sulphuric acid a “contact mass”
is charged into the chambers of the plant. This is formed by
soaking asbestos, or anhydrous magnesium sulphate, with
platinic chloride solution, and baking the mass to drive off
the chlorine. The contact mass usually contains from 7 to
8 per cent. platinum, in a very finely-divided state. In the
making of acetic acid from a mixture of air and alcohol
vapour, platinized asbestos is used. For the catalyzer used
in the conversion of ammonia into nitric acid a very fine-meshed
platinum gauze is used; this is strengthened at its
edges with platinum-iridium wire. One ounce of platinum
is required for the production per annum of 25 tons of catalytic
acid, or of 40 tons of nitric acid from ammonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the finely-divided state all the other metals of the
platinum group, especially palladium, have also the facility
of absorbing great quantities of certain gases, and can be
used as catalysts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to its high melting-point, and to the resistance to the
action of acids at high temperatures, platinum is largely used
for chemical ware in the form of crucibles, dishes, etc. Platinum
crucibles are indispensable in the chemical analysis of
rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In the electrical industry platinum is largely used for contact
points, in telegraph and telephone apparatus, in magneto-contacts,
and in the construction of the thermo-couples of
pyrometers. In the manufacture of jewellery, especially in
the crown-setting of diamonds, platinum has been much used
in the place of gold: alloyed with a little iridium it can be
worked into delicate designs, which are durable. During the
war, however, when platinum was largely wanted in the
making of munitions, its use in jewellery manufacture was
much restricted. Platinum was formerly largely used in dentistry.
In photography potassium platino-chloride is required
for producing platinotype prints. In the form of barium
platino-cyanide it is used in X-ray photography as a coating
for the projecting screen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum is required in the manufacture of certain parts
of chronometers, theodolites and watches; also for standard
weights and measures, and for various types of self-lighting
lamps<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 561.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Palladium</i> has its chief value as a substitute for platinum,
in palladium-gold alloys, which are used extensively in dentistry,
for jewellery and for chemical ware. It is also utilized
in the manufacture of astronomical instruments and watches,
also for plating metal ware<a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> p. 1002. The use of palladium
as a catalyzer is well known.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Iridium</i>, when pure, is of small value, being difficult to manipulate
on account of its brittleness. It is principally used in
alloy with platinum for hardening purposes. Jewellers’
platinum usually contains 10 per cent. iridium, and in the
electrical industry an alloy composed of from 15 to 50 per
cent. iridium is usually employed. Alloys with up to 10 per
cent. of iridium are ductile and malleable, but with over that
amount are hard and difficult to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The metal is used in the manufacture of fountain-pen
points, for which purpose the grains require careful selecting<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> p. 106;
also for standard weights and for contact points.
Iridium black, an oxide, is of value as a pigment for chinaware<a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> p. 1001.</p>

<p class='c007'>Iridium is suitable for sharp surgical instruments, and gold
needles with soldered iridium ends are employed for stitching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>wounds. It is also used in photography. Iridium is of greater
scarcity than platinum, hence its greater value.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Osmium.</i>—There is now little or no market for osmium.
It was formerly in considerable use for the manufacture of
incandescent lamps. Osmic acid is used for staining anatomical
preparations in microscopic work. On account of the
poisonous nature of its vapour the extraction of osmium is
costly and dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Ruthenium</i> is also of little or no commercial value. Both
these metals possess the disadvantages of being brittle and
easily oxidized.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rhodium</i> is of small commercial use. It is used principally
in alloy with platinum. An alloy containing 10 per cent.
rhodium is used for some thermo-couples of pyrometers, and
in the making of laboratory utensils.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Platinum Alloys.</i>—Platinum forms alloys with a number of
metals, but only a few are of industrial importance<a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> p. 400.
Platinum and iridium form a hard and elastic alloy, which
is unaffected by air, and takes a high polish. Alloyed
with 10 per cent. iridium platinum is used for one of
the wires in thermo-couples of pyrometers; and with 10 to
20 per cent. iridium for making standard measures of length
and weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum and copper form various alloys. An alloy with
18·75 per cent. copper, called “coopers’ gold,” takes a high
polish and closely resembles 18–carat gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>An alloy of platinum and silver containing 66 per cent.
silver is used as a standard of electrical resistance. An alloy
containing 20 to 30 per cent. silver is used in dentistry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum alloys with lead, zinc and other metals at low
temperatures; it is usually recovered from these alloys by
cupellation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum alloys with steel in all proportions. With 10 per
cent. platinum, rusting is prevented. A very elastic metal
is produced by alloying platinum with from 5 to 10 per cent.
gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The melting-point of silver is raised by alloying it with
platinum, but its thermal conductivity is lowered.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Alloy Substitutes for Platinum</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>On account of the scarcity and high price of the platinum
metals, much attention has lately been directed towards the
discovery of suitable substitutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the electrical industry an alloy of 3 parts of palladium
and 2 parts of silver is in use, also an alloy of nickel and
chromium. <i>Platinite</i>, an iron-nickel alloy, containing 46 per
cent. nickel and 0·15 per cent. carbon, has the same coefficient
of expansion as glass, and, when coated with copper, is used
to replace the platinum connection wires of incandescent
lamps. Tungsten is sometimes used for certain ignition
devices. For cathodes an alloy of 90 per cent. gold and 10
per cent. copper can be used to replace platinum; the same
alloy, if electrically coated with platinum, and then carefully
polished and burnished, is suitable for platinum anodes.</p>

<p class='c007'>For platinum chemical laboratory ware, there are several
substitutes, such as fused quartz; various iron, chromium, and
nickel-chromium alloys; <i>palau</i>, a gold-iridium alloy marketed
in California; <i>rhotanum</i>, a general name for gold-palladium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>alloys containing from 60 to 90 per cent. of gold, which are
suitable for most chemical purposes, except for use with hot
concentrated nitric acid, and for electrolytic anodes; <i>amaloy</i>,
which is a complex alloy containing nickel, chromium, tungsten,
etc., highly resistant to corrosion and to cold nitric and sulphuric
acids<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> p. 600.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the jewellery trade platinum has been replaced by an
alloy of 90 per cent. palladium and 10 per cent. rhodium. For
certain surgical work various <i>stellite</i> alloys, containing cobalt
and chromium, and hardened by the addition of tungsten
and molybdenum, are valuable substitutes for platinum, and
are not affected by antiseptic solutions. In dental work pins
are now made of tungsten coated with palladium<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> p. 549.
For most technical purposes an alloy of tungsten and nickel
with gold or silver is used in Germany; it may be cast, rolled
or forged, is acid-resisting, and capable of taking a high
polish<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a>. <i>White gold</i>, another substitute for platinum, contains
fine gold, from 75 to 85 per cent.; pure nickel, from
10 to 18 per cent.; and zinc, from 2 to 9 per cent. <i>Illium</i>, a
chromium-nickel-copper alloy reported recently as the discovery
of S. W. Parr, of Illinois, is a substitute for gold or
platinum, costing only 25 cents per ounce. It is stated to
have been a “50 per cent. standard of success.” The alloy
withstands hot or cold, strong or diluted acid, can be both
cast and machined, and is already used largely in the manufacture
of calorimeter bombs<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The results of researches made to discover substitutes for
platinum, and undertaken by the National Dental Association
of America, are described at length by F. A. Fahrenwald, in
a paper read in January 1916 before the American Institute
of Mining Engineers.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Scrap Platinum</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>A considerable amount of platinum in the form of old and
worn articles is now collected for return to the refineries, where
it is re-treated, and sold again as new metal. The trade in
scrap platinum has been particularly active in the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>States, official statistics showing that in 1916, 49,400 oz. of
refined platinum were recovered.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>World’s Output of Platinum</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>According to J. L. Howe, the estimated limits of the total
world-production of crude platinum, up to January 1917, were
as follows<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to obtain exact figures of the annual production
of crude platinum. This is particularly so in the case of
Russia, where there appears to have been a tendency for
private enterprises to keep their published outputs as low as
possible, in order to avoid registration. The discrepancy
between the official and actual figures of production in Russia
is variously estimated at from 20 to 60 per cent.</p>

<p class='c015'>Traces of platinum and iridium have been noticed in association
with the gold obtained from native workings at Bonai
City. The gold occurs in a deposit of iron oxide, which forms
the cementing material in a hard stratum of quartz pebbles.
The oxide is separated by pounding, and then washed away
to extract the gold. The proportion of platinum to gold is
probably less than 1 to 20.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum occurs, associated with gold, in the gravels of the
Irawaddy River in Burma. A small quantity of platinum is
obtained at Myitkyina by the Burma Gold Dredging Company.
During the years 1911–13, 152 oz. were won by this company.
In 1915 the output was 17·7 oz., and in 1916, 9·25 oz. In
1917, 4 oz. only were produced<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. Owing to the cessation
of the golddredging operations at Myitkyina, Burma has

<p class='c015'>Platinum has recently been located in the Gwelo district,
about 6 miles north-east of Indiva siding, where it occurs
in the great dyke of norite, which is here about 4 miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>wide. A. E. V. Zealley, the late assistant Government geologist,
made this occurrence the subject of a special report<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country rock is a serpentinized dunite. The deposit
is capped by a ferruginous siliceous gossan from 4 to 5 ft. wide,
which may be traced on the surface for about 100 ft., and is
comparable to a fissure vein. The gossan consists largely
of hæmatite and chalcedony, with occasional veinlets of
copper and nickel minerals. Although the presence of platinum
in the ore could not be detected by panning, the possibility
of its occurrence on geological grounds was considered, and
a sample of concentrate from an unstated amount of ore was
forwarded to the Imperial Institute for analysis. The sample
was found to contain platinum to the amount of 1 dwt. 20 gr.
per ton. A report on the further development of this deposit
is awaited with interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sample of concentrate from an unstated amount of material
from the gem-bearing gravels of Somabula Forest, Gwelo district,
was received at the Imperial Institute from the Director
of the Geological Survey of Southern Rhodesia in November,
1918. On analysis this sample yielded the following per ton:
platinum, 3 oz. 12 dwt.; osmiridium, 7 oz. The concentrate
also contained a large proportion of gold. As shown by the
latest information available, the deposits, although undoubtedly
rich, appear to extend over a limited area. According to an
analysis made at the Imperial Institute, a sample of chromite
from Southern Rhodesia (Selukwe) contained 0·17 per cent.

<p class='c007'>H. B. Maufe<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a> has stated that as the River Umtebekwe

in a reef in the Great Dyke (norite), at the head of the

<p class='c007'>The ore body consists of sulphides of copper and nickel, in
association with pyrrhotite, the minerals occurring disseminated

Gold and silver are also present in small quantities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average copper and nickel contents in the ore are each

the banket reef in one of the mines of the Klerksdorp district.
In the large majority of the gold mines, however, the platinum
metals, if present, appear to exist in such small quantities as
to escape detection.</p>

<p class='c007'>A series of samples of chromite from Kromdaal, near Rustenburg,

<p class='c007'>Since that time platinum has been found in a number of
localities associated with auriferous gravels, but the crude
metal has only been obtained commercially from the Similkameen
district in British Columbia. These deposits first
attracted attention in 1885. All the workings are alluvial,
although the platinum has in several cases been traced to its
parent source.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Alberta.</i>—Platinum and gold in minute grains, closely
intermixed, are found in the North Saskatchewan River, near
Edmonton. In 1918 certain platinum occurrences were
examined by the Munitions Resources Commission, visits
being paid to Fort Saskatchewan and the Peace River district,
in Alberta. These deposits, however, proved to be disappointing.
In the former locality, which was carefully tested by
drilling, the values of the samples obtained averaged less
than 10 cents in gold and platinum per c. yd. of gravel<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> p. 427.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>British Columbia.</i>—Platinum, associated with gold, which
is the dominant metal, occurs in the Tulameen River and its
tributaries, the principal of which is Slate Creek, others being
Cedar, Eagle, Bear and Granite Creeks. The metal is present
in small rounded grains, or pellets. Chromite is often found
intergrown with the platinum, olivine and pyroxene usually
occurring in association. The heavy minerals remaining with
platinum in the concentrate are titaniferous magnetite,
chromite and native copper. The platinum is sometimes
magnetic, probably due to the covering of the grains by small
particles of magnetite<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to the presence of osmiridium in considerable proportion,
the ore is classed as “hard metal,” and on that
account fetches a higher price. Many of the richer placers
have become exhausted, and work is now carried on by a few
individuals, principally Chinese, who work during the summer
months only. In some cases high benches, 50 to 100 ft. above
the creek bottom, are being worked. Much of the platinum
and gold is of a coarse texture, with a rough surface, and
the latter is sometimes found embedded in quartz. Nuggets
are sometimes found encrusted with chromite, and are thus
liable to be overlooked. The deposits are therefore not of
great age, and the metals have not been transported long
distances from their sources.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kemp is of opinion that the platinum is derived from
pyroxenite dykes cutting through peridotites, which outcrop
on Olivine and Grasshopper Mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is of interest to note that some diamonds and rubies
have been discovered with the platinum in the Tulameen
deposits. They are of good quality, but of small size, and
occur in a matrix of dunite<a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> p. 210. American capital
dominates the platinum industry in the district. In 1918,
at the request of the Imperial Munitions Board, special investigations
in this area were undertaken by members of the
Geological Survey, and several prospecting bores were put
down to bedrock. Full reports of the work done are not yet
available, but it is understood that the results are considered
to be promising, and to warrant further examination of the
district<a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> p. 429.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum was in 1918 discovered at Franklin Camp, near
Grand Forks, B.C., in the “Black Lead,” so-called, which is a
mixture of augite, 75·13 per cent.; orthoclase and microcline,
17·06 per cent.; hornblende, 1·47 per cent.; and magnetite,
6·06 per cent., as determined by microscopic measurements on
a typical specimen, with accessory minerals, chalcopyrite,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>bornite and apatite. A sample of chalcopyrite assayed 0·38 oz.
crude platinum per ton. Samples of the “Black Lead”
assayed from 0·02 to 0·17 oz. per ton<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Burnt Basin, on the Mother Lode claim, an auriferous
quartz vein carries platinum, in amounts varying from a trace
to 0·25 oz. per ton. The quartz also contains chalcopyrite,
pyrite, galena, sphalerite and molybdenite<a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a>. Native
platinum in small quantities has been found associated with
gold in the following localities: Tranquille River, Fraser
River, Rock Creek, Yale District, North Thompson and Clearwater
Rivers. It has also been reported to occur in a dyke
across the Kootenay River upon the Granite Poorman Mining
Company’s property a few miles from Nelson<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a>. At Siwash
Creek, in the Tulameen district, small flakes of platinum,
associated with chromite, often occur in shear zones in granite.
Dredging for gold and platinum is being carried on, on the
Peace River, North British Columbia.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to J. B. Hobson the heavy concentrate produced
on the Consolidated Caribo hydraulic mine at Quesnel, contains,
besides gold and silver, platinum, palladium and osmiridium,
one analysis giving a total value of $3,873 per ton.
The gold and silver being non-amalgamable are probably
included in particles of pyrite and galena, whilst the platinum
metals are found as minute grains or are enclosed in particles
of chromite and magnetite. A system of “under-currents” is
being installed to properly dress this concentrate<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1917 the recorded output of crude platinum from the
placer gravels of the Tulameen district in British Columbia
was 57 oz., that for 1918 being 39 oz. For the five years preceding
1892, this district produced on an average over 1,500 oz.
per year.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Manitoba.</i>—Samples of gold ore containing platinum have
been obtained in the Star Lake district of south-eastern
Manitoba<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. Analyses of the samples from different auriferous
reefs were made by the Department of Mines in 1917,
and yielded platinum varying in amount from a trace to 0·1 oz.
per ton. In addition to gold and platinum, the veins carry
small quantities of galena, zinc blende, pyrite, chalcopyrite
and arsenopyrite in a gangue consisting mainly of quartz.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Platinum is reported to occur in auriferous quartz veins in
several mines and prospects in Le Pas district; a picked
sample of ore from the mine of the Northern Manitoba and
Development Company, assayed $49 gold and $17 platinum
per ton<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a>. McCafferty’s Prospect, about 5 miles away,
contains platiniferous quartz.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Nova Scotia.</i>—According to E. R. Faribault in <cite>Summary
Report</cite>, 1918, Part F, of the Canadian Department of Mines,
platinum has been found, mostly in traces, in some of the old
gold districts of Halifax county and, lately, in the tungsten
concentrates of the Moose River mines. So far, all occurrences
are in quartz veins in the lower quartzite and slate formation
of the gold-bearing series of the Atlantic coast. The
platiniferous mineral is supposed to be sperrylite, with which
is associated arsenopyrite.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Ontario.</i>—Sudbury is one of the few places where platinum
is profitably extracted from deposits <i>in situ</i>. The metal,
which was first discovered in this region in 1889, is found mostly
in combination with arsenic, as sperrylite associated mainly
with chalcopyrite in the well-known copper and nickel-bearing
deposits of the district.</p>

<p class='c007'>The origin of the ore bodies has not yet been settled. They
are either marginal deposits in, or off-shoot deposits to, a norite
laceolith, which has intruded sedimentary rocks, the ores
consisting principally of chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, and pentlandite.
Metallic platinum, gold, silver and palladium occur in
the ore, the last also, probably, as an arsenide. The highest
platinum content is associated with the highest copper content;
the highest palladium with the highest nickel. According
to Roberts and Longyear<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a> the mean analysis of rocks
of from sixteen drill holes gave an average ore content of:
copper, 1·11 per cent.; nickel, 1·95 per cent.; silver, 0·223 oz.;
gold, 0·022 oz.; and metallic platinum, 0·0068 oz. per ton. The
ore is principally worked for its nickel and copper content,
and yields a large proportion of the world’s supply of nickel.
The ore is first smelted at the mines, and a portion of the low-grade
matte so produced is then shipped to South Wales for
final treatment, the remainder being sent to the recently-constructed
refinery of the International Nickel Co., at Port
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Colborne, Ontario, and to the United States. It was stated
in 1903 that this matte contained on the average 1·25 oz. of
the platinum metals per ton of nickel content of the matte,
of which about 80 per cent. was extracted<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> p. 10. The
Victoria Mine, owned by the Mond Nickel Co., is stated to
carry a high percentage of the precious metals, as is also the
Vermilion Mine, although in the latter case the ore body is
very small. In 1917 the total output of copper-nickel ore
from these deposits amounted to 1,506,828 tons, of which the
Canadian Copper Co. raised 1,139,629 tons, the Mond Nickel
Co. 361,335 tons, and the Alexo Mining Co. 5,864 tons. The
nickel content of the ore of the Canadian Copper Co. was
about 2·5 times that of the copper, whilst the ore mined
by the other two companies contained the two metals in
approximately equal proportions. The matte produced by
the Alexo Mining Co. is smelted by the Mond Nickel Co.
According to the report of the Royal Ontario Nickel Commission,
the matte produced by the Canadian Copper Co. in 1916
was estimated to contain 4,640 oz. platinum and 8,460 oz.
palladium, corresponding to 0·10 oz. platinum and 0·15 oz.
palladium per ton of matte, the International Nickel Co.
recovering in that year 1,093 oz. platinum and 257 oz. allied
metals. This company is now reported to have improved its
methods of recovery. In 1918 the total matte shipment by
the Canadian Copper Co. is stated to have contained, among
other precious metals, 8,677 oz. platinum and 13,016 oz.
palladium<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to information supplied by the Mond Nickel Co.,
their nickel residues derived from the refining of the matte
are taken over by Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co., Ltd. During the
years 1915–18 the residues disposed of were estimated to contain
the following amounts of platinum metals:</p>

<p class='c007'>The British America Nickel Corporation, who are developing
some large deposits in the same district, are also erecting a refinery
near Hull on the Ottawa River. It is stated that they will
employ the Hybinette process of electrolytic refining, and expect
to obtain a high recovery of the precious metals<a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> p. 425.</p>

<p class='c007'>With gradual improvements in the refining process, and
with the refining of the whole of the matte produced, instead
of a portion only, as at present, it seems probable that the
production of platinum metals by the three nickel companies
may in time exceed 10,000 oz. per annum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 1919 report of the Ontario Bureau of Mines shows that
in 1918 the International Nickel Co. treated 62,250 tons of

<p class='c007'>The question of the refining of platinum in Australia has
been under consideration for some time; so far the crude
material has all been sent to England. The outlook for
future production of crude platinum in Australia is not
promising, with the exception of that of Bald Hill district,
Tasmania.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>New South Wales.</i>—Platinum is obtained at Platina, in the
Fifield division, in the east central part of the State, from a
buried gravel channel, in which it occurs in association with
gold and osmiridium. The rocks in the vicinity of the “leads”
consist chiefly of slates, but the source of the platinum is not
known<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 557. These deposits were first exploited in 1894,
and from that year to 1918 inclusive, the total output of
platinum from New South Wales was 14,680 oz.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a>. The
gravels have yielded amounts of 6 dwt. platinum and 2 dwt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>gold per ton, but according to Government reports the richer
deposits are nearly worked out; mining operations are carried
on with great difficulty, as there is a great scarcity of water
and a deep overburden, varying from 20 to 80 ft. in depth.
It is estimated that there are 200 acres of platinum-country
available, sufficiently rich to pay, were it worked on a large
scale with an abundant supply of water<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new occurrence has recently been discovered about 1
mile distant from the old Platina deep “lead,” the platinum
being associated with small quantities of gold. The “lead”
has so far been proved to extend over an area about 1 mile
in length, and from 60 to 150 ft. in width, the wash varying
in depth from a few feet to up to about 80 ft. The pay gravels,
which rest on shales and sandstones of Silurian and Devonian
age, intruded by dioritic dykes, are stated to be from 1 to 3 ft.

<p class='c007'>Platinum is frequently found in beach sand deposits on the
coastal border between Queensland and New South Wales,
notably at Ballina, close to the mouth of the Richmond River;
at Evans Head, further south; and at Currumbin, near the
mouth of the Tweed River. In this locality black sands containing
platinum, associated with gold, cassiterite, monazite
and osmiridium, accumulate on the beaches during stormy
weather. At Ballina and Evans Head, the platinum predominates
over the gold, but at Currumbin, further south, the
gold is in the greater quantity<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 557. The minerals are
present in a very finely-divided state, and separation of the
valuable metals is a matter of considerable difficulty. The
problem does not appear to have been satisfactorily solved up
to the present time, although promising experiments have
recently been carried out with screening and magnetic treatment.
The deposits are, unfortunately, very low grade.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The sources of the metals are uncertain. The platinum and
osmiridium appear to have been derived from the western
edge of the Clarence coal measures, which now exist only as
fragmentary outcrops. The gold, tin and monazite may have
their origin in granite and other rocks of the New England
tableland. Chromite is present in some of the Currumbin
sands, which suggests serpentine as the probable source of
platinum<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 557. Other associations are zircon, garnet,
tourmaline, ilmenite, magnetite and sapphire.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Broken Hill district, principally at Little Darling
and Mulga Springs Creek, platinum has been proved to extend
over a considerable area in a copper-nickel gossan, closely
associated with gabbro, decomposed gneisses and schists. In
addition to platinum, the amounts of which vary from a trace
to 16 dwt. per ton, gold, silver, iridium and palladium are
also present<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a>. The deposits bear some resemblance to the
nickel deposits of Sudbury, Ontario, and it is thought that here,
too, the platinum occurs combined with arsenic, as sperrylite.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Queensland.</i>—In addition to the beach deposits between
Southport and Currumbin, described above, platinum has
been found in Coopooroo and Wairamba Creeks on the Russell
Goldfield, near Innisfail; also in the Lucknow and Alma
“reefs” of the Gympie Goldfield, where it is present in quartz
lodes with native gold, and arsenopyrite, the accompanying
rocks consisting of slates, alternating with volcanic tuffs and
conglomerates; the metal also exists in the neighbouring
gold-bearing alluvial deposits of Brickfield Gully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another occurrence of alluvial platinum is known at the
head of the Don River in Central Queensland<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 556.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Victoria.</i>—Platinum occurs in the Walhalla Copper Mine,
where it is associated in a hornblende-diorite lode-formation
with copper pyrites, gold and silver. The ore is stated to contain
from 2 to 7 dwt. platinum per ton. In the Thompson
River Copper Mine platinum is found in a hornblendic rock
rich in chalcopyrite.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Tasmania.</i>—Iridosmine has been produced from the Bald
Hill district near Waratah, in the north-western part of the
state, since 1900, the metal being obtained from placer deposits
in Nineteen Mile Creek and its tributaries, Linger-and-Die,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>McGinty’s and Barren Creeks, and from Savage River. It
has been located <i>in situ</i> in the rocks of Bald Hill, principally
in serpentine, but also with chalcedony and opaline silica in
lode-formations. In the former case, it is associated with
magnetite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, nickel and gold. The iridosmine
in the placer deposits is sometimes coated with iron oxide, and
is also at times found enclosed in chromite. The following
analysis in percentages, made at the Imperial Institute, is
typical: osmium, 57·09; iridium, 33·80; platinum, 0·37;
ruthenium, 8·19; palladium, 0·21; gold, 0·04; iron, 0·30;

<p class='c007'><i>South Australia.</i>—In the north-east part of the State traces
of platinum have been recognized by analysis as occurring in
the outcrop of a lode near Boolcoomatta. Further information
on this occurrence is not available.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Papua.</i>—Osmiridium, associated with small amounts of
gold only, is known to occur as alluvial in the neighbourhoods
of various serpentine areas; in the Lakekamu district, in
flaky form; in the Yodda Valley, in appearance similar to
native bismuth; and in other places in shot-like granules<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>New Zealand</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Platinum is only obtained commercially in New Zealand
from the Orepuki district of Southland, where it is produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>by the Round Hill Gold Mining Company as a by-product in
the washing of auriferous gravels. According to information
recently supplied by the Mines Department, the annual output
of crude platinum for the last ten years has averaged 30 oz.,
but in view of the recent falling-off of the gold production in
this locality, the prospects of any increase in the output of
platinum seem small.</p>

<p class='c007'>In South Island the presence of platinum has been reported
on the Thames River in quartz lodes, in a region of serpentine
and diorite, and in a pyritic lode near the Taramakau River in
the district of Westland, in close proximity to sheets of altered
magnesian eruptive rocks<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 557. The platinum in the
latter case occurs in association with silver, in the proportions
of about 7 parts of the latter to 1 of the former, together
with pyrite and limonite. Samples taken from the lode have
been stated to have an average content of 3 dwt. 8 gr. platinum
per ton<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other localities in South Island where platinum has been
located are the Taraka and George Rivers, which flow into
Awarua Bay; the east coast of Otago, in beach sands and
river gravels; the Clutha River; and the Nelson gold district.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concentrates containing up to 2·5 per oz. per ton are reported
to have been obtained from the Parapara sub-division.
Platinum in New Zealand is often associated with gold, and
the deposits are in many cases similar to those of the Urals.</p>

<p class='c015'>Platinum has recently been discovered in Westphalia, deposits
having been found in Freudenberg, Siegen, Meschede,
in Siegerland, Sauerland and Westerwald. It occurs in a
series of fragmental deposits, including principally slates and
graywackes, the latter composed of quartz and slate, with an
argillaceous cement; it is also occasionally found in the recemented
fragments which are presumably derived from the
basal granite formation, underlying the platinum series<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> p. 606.
The beds are believed to be of marine origin,
and are probably of Silurian and Devonian age. The platinum,
which is present in a very finely-disseminated state, is associated
with chromium, nickel, arsenic, antimony, iron, copper,
lead, zinc, silver and gold, some of which appear to have been
introduced by solutions at a stage subsequent to sedimentation.
Krusch investigated these deposits in 1914, and is of opinion,
in view of the similarity of the chemical associations with those
of the Ural and British Columbian formations, that the
original source of the platinum was peridotite, or other form
of basic igneous rock. A number of samples, analysed by
Krusch, yielded values ranging from a trace to 33·5 gm.
(1 oz. troy) platinum per ton<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a>. At the outbreak of war
the capital necessary for exploitation had not been raised, but
in 1918 it was stated that treatment works had been erected
at Wenden<a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As mentioned above, about 25 per cent. of the Russian
output of platinum before the war was refined in Germany,

<p class='c015'>Up to the year 1914, Russia produced about 93 per cent.
of the total world’s supply of platinum, the metal being derived
from extensive deposits of alluvial sands in the Ural Mountains.
The platiniferous area extends approximately 80 miles along
the central part of the chain of mountains in the Government
of Perm, and along the eastern slope, the principal centre of
the placers being at Goroblagodat, and on the western side at
Nizhni-Tagilsk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum was first discovered in the Urals in 1823, and
exploitation commenced in the following year. In 1828 the
Russian Government instituted platinum coinage, which consisted
of 3–rouble, 6–rouble and 12–rouble pieces, the coins
containing about 2 per cent. iridium. A 3–rouble piece
weighed 10·31 gm., and the price paid by the Government
to the producers was 16<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per oz.; but owing to the subsequent
rise in value of platinum, the coinage was discontinued
in 1845<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> p. 606.</p>

<p class='c007'>The platinum industry began to develop in 1869, the price
at that time being under £5 per lb.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a>, but from that year
onwards the value, although subject to considerable fluctuations,
has steadily increased. It has been estimated that
since the beginning of the industry in Russia, about 6,000,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>oz. of platinum have been recovered from 30,000,000 to

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The platinum industry in Russia has always been mainly
in the hands of a few large firms of foreign countries. For a
long time Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co., Ltd. controlled the greater
part of the trade. In 1898 the Société Anonyme de l’Industrie
du Platine was established in Paris, and, by purchasing a large
number of mines, and leasing others, was able to secure a large
share in the control of the industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refining of the crude platinum has been, and still is,
almost entirely in foreign hands, all but approximately 2 per
cent. of the entire output being refined abroad. In 1915 it
was reported that the construction of a refinery at Ekaterinburg
was completed, which was to be placed under Government
control. The principal platinum-refining works were formerly
those of Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co., Ltd., of England, but early
in the eighties this firm was, to a certain extent, superseded
by Heraeus &amp; Co., of Hanau, Germany. They, in turn, in
1909, were compelled to give first place to the Société Anonyme
de l’Industrie du Platine, of Paris, which became the chief
centre of the platinum-refining industry, a position which it
held until the outbreak of war. France at that time had a
monopoly of 90 per cent. of the Russian production. This
foreign control had an unfavourable effect on the industry,
and in 1913 the Russian Government passed a law forbidding
the exportation of crude platinum. In July 1915, exportation
was again permitted, subject to a 30 per cent. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</span></i>
export tax, and at about the same time an order was issued
forbidding the exportation of raw platinum in quantities
valued above 500 roubles (£53), the price of the metal to be
fixed by the State<a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> p. 923. In February 1917 the
Government further enacted an order prohibiting the importation
of drawn and spun platinum. It was hoped by
these means to encourage the establishment of domestic
refineries. In 1916 the Government fixed the price at £16 10s.

not satisfied, and later sales were reported up to £22 per oz.
of crude metal, 83 per cent. fine<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> p. 17.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to N. Vissotzki<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a>, the platiniferous belt
of the Urals, geologically speaking, consists of four parallel
bands striking, roughly, north and south; the westernmost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of these, made up of crystalline schists, forms the watershed
between Europe and Asia. The next band to the east comprises
olivine- and mica-gabbros, diallage-peridotites, diorites
and altered syenites—all of which have been erupted from a
great depth. The third band is made up of Lower Devonian
sedimentary rocks, shattered and buried in places by diabasic
eruptive rocks. The eastern portion of this band is formed of
eruptive rocks of deep-seated origin which may be gneissose
granites. The fourth, or most easterly band, is composed
of ancient rocks, which have been eroded by the advancing
sea of Lower Tertiary age.</p>

<p class='c007'>The area emerged from the waves as early as the Carboniferous
period; consequently the accumulation of
platinum, and in some localities of gold, in the surface-deposits,
were not swept away. They were concentrated later on in the
alluvia—perhaps at the time of the most intense glaciation,
probably in the Pleistocene.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout the Urals, the primary source of the platinum
is associated with the eruptive basic rocks, among which the
platiniferous and auriferous dunite forms three great masses.
The principal outcrops of platiniferous dunite and platinum-bearing
alluvia are connected with the second of the four
parallel bands mentioned above. Towards the south, the
band becomes discontinuous, and finally dies out altogether.
Here a few outcrops of platiniferous olivine-rock contain a
small percentage of platinum, with osmiridium and other
members of the group associated with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two principal platinum-producing districts are in the
central Urals, and are: (1) The Shuvaloff Estates, Isov
district, on the River Iss, near Goroblagodat. (2) The Demidoff
Estates, Nizhni-Tagilsk district, on the Martian River in the
South Verkhotur district. Prior to 1879 the latter field
furnished the larger part of the platinum, but since then the
former has been the most productive, and now supplies about
80 per cent. of the total output. The whole of the platinum
is derived from gravel deposits, which are usually auriferous,
and associated with dunite.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Isov district.</i>—Platinum is concentrated in the channels
of the Rivers Iss, Veeya and Tura. In the north of this region
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>it is obtained from the Sosnovki, Kytlymi, and Mala Kosva
Rivers; further north again, platinum occurs with gold in the
Vagran River, and in the system comprising the Rivers Lobva,
Niasma, Lialia, Aktai, Emerlo and Talits, the gold here being
predominant. Other sources of supply of platinum and gold
in this district are on the Ivdevl River. In the south of the
area, platinum deposits are worked on the tributaries of the
Tagil, Salda, Imiaun and Tura Rivers<a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> p. 921.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Nizhni-Tagilsk district.</i>—The richest placers occur in
the valleys of the Visim, Martian, Sisim, Chaush and Cherna
Rivers. Further south, platinum is found with gold in the
gravels of the Nevian, Verkhne-Iset, Bilenibaev, Alapaev,
Sysert, Kyshtym and Mias areas, and also in the Tanalyk,
Sakmar and Urtazym Rivers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other localities of smaller importance are the Nikolae
Pavdinsk and Rastes districts in the northern Urals, and the
Systersk mining district.</p>

<p class='c007'>The placers are derived from country rock, made up of
serpentine gabbro, diallage and olivenite, the principal associated
minerals being quartz, zircon, ilmenite, chromite,
magnetite, spinel, native gold and palladium. Gold is present
in the concentrate in very variable quantities, and sometimes
contains silver, but the latter generally occurs in combination
with palladium. The crude platinum usually includes some
iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and iron.</p>

<p class='c007'>The basic igneous rocks, from which the platinum is derived,
are exposed in the form of discontinuous elliptical outcrops
near the summits of the Urals, particularly on the western
side of the mountains. These outcrops attain larger dimensions
in the northern and central Urals than further south.
The process of concentration of platinum in the gravels has
clearly extended over a very long period of time, and it is
probable that the richer gravels have been reconcentrated,
perhaps several times<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> p. 299. Platinum nuggets are
rarely found, but three of large size were discovered in the
Nizhni-Tagilsk district, their weights respectively being
25½ lb., 21 lb., and 11½ lb.</p>

<p class='c007'>Duparc, in a brief description of the geology of the deposits,
states that they are essentially of magmatic origin. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>structure of the rock is in the nature of concentric bandings;
the felspathic rocks at the outer edge gradually grade into the
intermediate stage of pyroxenes, until the central dunite is
reached, composed of olivine and chromite. The richness of
the gravels is in proportion to the size of the dunite deposits,
and to the extent of erosion of these rocks. According to
Duparc, platinum ore derived from a pyroxenite source usually
contains high percentages of platinum and palladium, but
low percentages of osmium and iron. The same writer estimated
in 1916 that the reserves were sufficient for about
twelve years, provided that the same methods of working and
rate of extraction were employed during that period<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The amount of the platinum in the wash is very variable.
The average yield was formerly over ½ oz. per c. yd., but
latterly, owing to the gradual exhaustion of the richer deposits,
the average returns have not exceeded from 2 to 3 dwt.
per c. yd. The crude metal assays about 83 per cent.
platinum, from 5 to 7 per cent. osmium and iridium, with
small amounts of ruthenium, palladium, and gold, and about
10 per cent. impurities, mostly iron and copper<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a>. The
thickness of the pay gravels varies from 3 to 6 ft., and about
4 ft. may be taken as the average width, the overburden
running from a few to over 60 ft. The extent of the productive
area is about 170 sq. miles, and from 15,000 to
20,000 miners were employed before the war<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 558. It
has been noticed that the platinum deposits are characterized
by their uniformity, of course not being so sinuous in direction
as gold deposits.</p>

<p class='c007'>In former times mining was entirely carried on by primitive
methods with hand labour, but the utilization of dredges
has steadily increased, since their introduction in 1900. In
1909, 13 per cent. of the total production was obtained by
dredging, and in 1914 this percentage rose to one-third of the
total output. The season during which dredges may be
employed extends on the average from the middle of April
to the middle of October. In the South Verkhotur and Perm
areas dredges have been used in the large enterprises; but
at the small mines the working is very primitive, and carried
on largely with the help of <i>starateli</i>, or tributers. In 1914 a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>modern 7½ c. ft. dredge was installed on the Nikolaie-Pavdinsk
Estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In mines where dredging is not in use, the gravels are mined
by open cuts, or, if the overburden is thick, shafts are employed.
The former method is much preferred, both on account of its
relative cheapness, and also because it is possible to obtain
a better clean-up of the bedrock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The usual types of stationary plant in use include the <i>botchka</i>,
or conical revolving screen; the <i>tchaska</i>, or puddling machine,
with a bottom of perforated iron plates; and the <i>boronka</i>, or
conical screen, on which the stones and clay are turned over
by a double rake<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a>. The gold is removed by amalgamation
with mercury in wood, iron or porcelain bowls. Special
methods are in use in certain parts of Russia for working the
deposits during the winter. The workings are allowed to
freeze, and the frozen ground is mined after being partially
thawed by means of wood fires. The method is simple, but
care must be taken to ensure that the thawing does not proceed
too far, otherwise the ground collapses, and the workings become
flooded. The method is suitable for depths to 30 ft.,
and in localities where the snowfall is comparatively slight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Latest reports from Russia indicate that no dredges are
now working there, the platinum being produced by hand
methods only.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some interesting experiments were recently carried out by
V. N. Chorzhevski in the Nizhni-Tagilsk district, with a view
to testing the commercial possibility of mining platinum <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
situ</span></i>. The metal here occurs, in association with chrome iron
ore, in dunite rock, which in this region extends over an area
of 11½ sq. miles. The platinum appears to be present in
quantities directly proportional to the amount of chromite in
the rock. The dunite is first ground under runners; the
chromite slack is separated from it; and after this has undergone
a second grinding, the metal is separated by washing<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a>.
An experimental test, carried out in March 1917, is stated to
have produced over 200 oz. platinum from 9,720 lb. chromite
slack. Another experiment with 3,600 lb. of grey slack, “or
fines,” consisting chiefly of undecomposed dunite obtained from
the dredges, is reported to have yielded ⅓ oz. of platinum.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><i>Lapland.</i>—Platinum occurs associated with chromite and
diamonds, in alluvial deposits on the Ivalo River. It is believed
to be derived from serpentine rock, of which the neighbouring
country is largely composed<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 556.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Finland.</i>—Platinum has been found in the south in a lode-formation
containing quartz, siderite, calcite and dolomite.
Gold and carbonate of copper are also present in small quantities.<a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> p. 557.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Platinum Currency</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>In a dispatch to the Great Powers on February 26, 1920,
the Soviet Government promised to withdraw the decree
annulling Russia’s foreign debt, to pay arrears of interest, and
giving as a guarantee to an Anglo-American syndicate certain
important platinum and silver-mining concessions, in return
for which the abandonment of intervention in Russia’s internal
affairs was demanded. To be used in payment of foreign
purchases, the Government was about to issue “platinum”
credit notes of 50, 100, 500, and 5,000 roubles, the issue to be
limited to 65,000,000 roubles, and backed by platinum reserves
of 37,500,000 roubles. The Government would be ready to
convert the platinum reserves into coin if required<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Spain</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Promising deposits of platinum have recently been reported
at Ronda, in the province of Malaga. Domingo de Orueta, a
Government geologist, having noticed the similarity of the
geology of this district to that of the platiniferous deposits
of the Urals, proceeded, a few years ago, to explore the area
systematically, and was soon rewarded, in the discovery of the
metal. The deposits, which are alluvial, extend along the
Verde and Guadaiza rivers, and are derived from serpentine and
peridotite rocks, the latter composed principally of rhombic
pyroxene, with some spinel and some dunite. Chromite occurs
in association with the platinum. The pay gravels contain
about 8 gr. platinum per ton, and are stated to have an average
thickness of 5 ft., the depth of overburden in the Guadaiza
area, where apparently the richer gravels are found, being
about 33 ft., as compared with 49 ft. in the Verde locality<a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>p. 547. The Spanish Government have taken over the
exploitation of these deposits, and no public prospecting,
without Government permission, is allowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum is known to exist in a number of other localities
in Spain, especially in the northern districts; but so far as is
known, it occurs in very small quantities of no commercial
importance. The metal has been recognized in the following
rivers: Minho, Luna, Sil, Orbigo, Gallego, Cinca Darro and
Lower Jenil, where it occurs in the concentrate sands, accompanied
by magnetite, ilmenite, zircon and, frequently, gold<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ASIA</h3>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Armenia</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Platinum, in association with gold, is reported to occur
in the district of Batum and Sasun, on the Charokh River<a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> p. 610.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Borneo</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Platinum was discovered in south-eastern Borneo in 1831,
in the gravels of Gunung Lawack, but for a long time the
natives were ignorant of its value. In recent years it has been
obtained on a small scale as a by-product in the process of
gold-washing, carried on in the province of Tanah-Laut, in
the south-eastern extremity of the island<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a>. The deposits
occur in streams, which rise in the Bobaris Mountains, where
the country rocks are composed of schists and gneisses, intruded
by serpentine gabbro and diorite dykes<a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> p. 298.
Platinum has, however, not yet been located <i>in situ</i>. In
addition to gold, the platinum is associated with osmiridium
in the gravels, the two former being frequently found intimately
intergrown. The platinum content of the native
metal has been found by a number of analyses to vary from
about 57 to 83 per cent., and that of osmiridium from 0·18
to 10·07 per cent.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rare mineral <i>laurite</i>, a sulphide of ruthenium and
osmium, was discovered in these deposits.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to L. Hundeshagen<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a>, the platinum occurring
in the diamond placers of western and south-eastern Borneo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>is in the form of thin scales, ranging from 0·1 to 1·0 mm. in
length. These platinum scales contain from 3·8 to 4·5 per
cent. of copper, evidently as an alloy.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>China</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>In the Uryanchai district of Mongolia, situated on the
Russian border, deposits of auriferous gravels have been
worked on a fairly extensive scale for some time past. It
was announced a few years ago that platinum and iridium
had been found in appreciable quantities, associated with the
gold, some large platinum nuggets being obtained from this
region in 1911. Although no attempt at commercial development
has yet been made, the prospects of profitable extraction
appear to be hopeful. Extensive outcrops of olivine rocks
have been noticed in the vicinity, and the nature of the occurrence
is stated to bear some resemblance to that of the platiniferous
fields of the southern Urals<a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> p. 107.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Japan</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Platinum occurs in the Yubari-garva, Pechau and other
rivers in the province of Hokkaido. It is also found in Nishi-Mikawa,
province of Sado. In the former locality gold and
iridosmine are associated with the platinum, and in the latter
gold and iron sands are present<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a>. In no case has the metal
been traced to its parent source. In the Hokkaido deposits
the average quantity of platinum present is only 2 or 3 per
cent. of the iridosmine content. It is possible that further
exploration in these areas will reveal occurrences of greater
importance<a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> p. 597.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sumatra</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Platinum is obtained at Sipongi, where it occurs with
wollastonite and grossularite in limestones and schists, near
intrusions of granodiorite and augite diorite. Gold is also
present.</p>

<p class='c007'>L. Hundeshagen<a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> is of opinion that the present ore deposit
was originally a layer, or a big lens, of limestone embedded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in the old schists, which has, by apophyses of granite, been
altered into garnet and wollastonite, being at the same time,
or very soon afterwards, mineralized by hot solutions carrying
copper, gold, platinum, etc. A sample of slightly decomposed
wollastonite with no copper, or only minute traces of that
metal, proved to be richest in platinum, the assay showing
6 gm. of platinum per 1,000 kg., while samples with 2 to 10
per cent. of bornite and malachite contained only traces of
platinum; and none could be detected in auriferous garnet,
poor in wollastonite. About 10 to 25 metres from the outcrop
the concentrated river sand shows small particles of whitish
crystalline gold and rounded grains of white platinum, the
latter varying from 0·1 to 0·3 mm. in size.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>AFRICA</h3>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Congo Free State</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>In the Katanga district, platinum and palladium have been
reported to occur in certain alluvial gravels, accompanied by
gold and silver. One sample from this locality is stated to
have yielded the following amounts per metric ton: 3·4
gr. platinum, 12·3 gr. gold, 8·3 gr. silver. It has also been
located <i>in situ</i> in sandstones containing gold.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Madagascar</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>Platinum is produced on a small scale as a by-product in
alluvial gold mining on the Vatana River, near the village of

also been found in auriferous gravels in the regions of Fenerive,
Marolambo, and Vandrozo, over an area extending along the
eastern side of the island for a length of about 450 miles.
The platinum is apparently derived from the decomposition of
pegmatite. It is rarely found pure, being usually coated with
iron oxide, and strongly magnetic, a property which is utilized
in the process of separation from the gold<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>United States</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>At the beginning of the war there was a considerable shortage

the imports, and in part owing to the increased demand in
connexion with munition manufacture.</p>

<p class='c007'>California is the principal producer of crude platinum, and
in 1917 this State supplied 460 oz. out of the total output of

<p class='c007'><a href='#rN'>N</a>. Including manufactured platinum.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>In 1917, 38,831 oz. of refined platinum metals, of which
7,384 oz. is believed to have been of domestic origin, were
recovered from alloy with other metals, and 72,186 oz. were
obtained from the refining of scrap metal, and sweepings.
The shortage was also to some extent relieved by the receipt
from Russia early in 1918 of a special consignment of 20,922
oz. of crude platinum, which had been collected in 1917 by the
Russian-English Bank, and which was taken out of Russia by
F. W. Draper and delivered to the United States Government.
It yielded 17,640 oz. platinum, 64·75 oz. palladium, 182·11 oz.
iridium and 48·56 oz. of rhodium, a total of 85·725 per cent.
of platinum metals, slightly above the usual 83 per cent.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Alaska.</i>—The first production of platinum in Alaska was in
1916, in which year about 12 oz. were shipped to the United
States. In 1917 the output rose to 81 oz., of which 66 oz.
were obtained from the Seward Peninsula and 15 oz. from the
Copper River country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1918 an increased output of 135 oz. was partly obtained
from alluvial deposits and partly as a by-product in the
treatment of copper ore of the Salt Chuck mine, Ketchikan<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This mine is a palladium-copper mine containing mainly
bornite with a little chalcopyrite, and the alteration products
covellite and chalcocite, the metals present being, besides
copper and palladium, gold, silver and platinum. The ratio
of palladium to platinum averages 50 to 1. The concentrates
produced, representing about 3½ per cent. of the weight of
the ore, contain: copper, 40 per cent.; gold, 1·2 oz.; silver,
5·3 oz.; and platinum metals, 3·15 oz. per ton<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Seward Peninsula the larger portion is derived from
placer deposits in Dyme Creek, Koyuk district, where the
gravels are primarily worked for gold, 1 oz. platinum being
obtained for every $5,000 worth of gold. In 1918, 56 oz.
were recovered. Bear Creek and Sweepstake Creek have
also supplied small quantities of platinum, and a little is
derived from placers on Boob Creek, in the Tolstoi district
<a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> p. 19.</p>

<p class='c007'>A possible source of platinum appears to lie in the neighbourhood
of the Red Mountain, on the Kenai Peninsula. The
mountain is composed of fine-grained dunite, in which abundant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>chromite occurs. Up to 1917 no placer mining had been
attempted in this locality<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c011'><sup>[68]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Goodro Mine, at the head of Kasaan Bay, Prince of
Wales Island, were found in 1918 both platinum and palladium,
the latter in greater amount, and carried in bornite and chalcopyrite;
some chalcocite and covellite are present also in the
ore. The copper minerals are disseminated through pyroxenite,
and the country rock consists of limestones, slates and other
sedimentaries. The platinum content is small, but regular,
whilst the amount of palladium present is proportional to the
amount of copper, there being about 1 oz. of palladium to
every 8 to 12 per cent. (units) of copper<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Bill has been introduced into Congress providing for the
incorporation of the United States Platinum Corporation, with
capital stock of $30,000,000, the object of which is to secure
a concession from the Government of land areas in Alaska
containing platinum sands, and to pay for such privilege, as a
royalty or subsidy, one-eighth of the net profits obtained
from the working of the concession<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>California and Oregon.</i>—Platinum has been proved to exist
over a wide area in placer deposits associated with gold, but
the proportion of the platinum metals to the gold is usually
small. Platinum is obtained from sands in streams rising in
the belt of serpentine rocks in central California, and from the
serpentine areas in the Siskiyou and Trinity counties in the
north-west of the State, which continue north-east into Curry,
Josephine and Jackson counties in south-western Oregon<a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> p. 300.
The sources of the platinum obtained along the
foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada were old stream channels on
the western slopes of the mountains, which are now buried
beneath lava several hundred feet deep. These “deep
leads” are also mined by drifting for their gold and platinum
contents, and in a few cases a fair amount of the metals is
extracted from them. Some platinum is obtained by hydraulic
mining, but this is carried on with difficulty, owing to the
prevailing scarcity of water<a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> p. 18.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum occurs in black sands found on the Pacific coast
in the counties of Coos, Curry and Josephine, Oregon and Del
Norte, California. Formerly these beach deposits were rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>in platinum, but at the present small quantities only are
obtainable after stormy weather. This area has recently been
examined by the United States Bureau of Mines, but the
results were disappointing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In California most of the output of platinum is produced by
dredging for gold in the Butte, Calaveras and Stanislaus
counties<a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> p. 19. In Trinity county mining is in progress
on the Trinity River, about 4 miles below Junction City,
by the Valdos Dredging Co. The output from this source
for sixteen months in 1916–17 was stated to be 1,950 gm.
Platinum, with gold and osmiridium, is also obtained on
the Yuba River, about 12 miles east of Marysville in Yuba
county, by the Yuba Consolidated Goldfields<a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> p. 540.
Some alluvial platinum has been recovered at the Bean Hill
Gold Mine, situated 12 miles south-east of Placerville, and this
locality is at present under investigation<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a>. Californian
metal contains from 25 to 45 per cent. iridium. Its origin is
believed to be the serpentine- and olivine-bearing rocks of the
Sierra Nevada and other ranges.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Oregon, in addition to the platinum obtained from the
beach deposits near Bullards and Marshfield<a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> p. 20, it
occurs in placer deposits, rich in chromite, in south-west
Oregon, the principal output being derived from the Waldo
district.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum also exists in small quantities in streams in the
neighbourhood of the Blue Mountains, eastern Oregon, where
the Powder River Gold Dredging Co., in Sumpter district,
produces on a small scale. Other platiniferous localities in
eastern Oregon are the Granite and Canyon districts, and
Spanish Gulch in Wheeler county<a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> p. 541.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colorado.</i>—Platinum is known to exist in the black sands
from Clear Creek. Its presence has also been reported in the
gold gravels of the Iron Hill placer at Como, where it occurs
mechanically combined with magnetite. Another occurrence
recently discovered is in a vein worked by the Rollcall Mining
Co., near Villa Grove. An assay of material from this vein,
taken at a depth of 1,500 ft., showed the following values:
gold, 3·2 oz.; platinum, 5·09 oz.; silver, 3·05 oz.; and copper, 3·5
per cent.<a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> p. 592.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><i>Nevada.</i>—In 1909 the occurrence of platinum in Clark
county was noticed by the United States Geological Survey to
be in association with copper, nickel and cobalt ores from the
Key West and Great Eastern Mines, near Bunkerville. The
ore bodies are contained in pegmatites and basic intrusions,
which carry pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite, the platinum content
in the ore averaging about 0·2 oz. per ton<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1914 platinum, with palladium, was discovered at the
Boss Gold Mine, situated 10 miles west of Goodsprings, in
Clark county. The mine was originally worked for copper,
and later for its copper and gold contents. The country
rock consists of limestone of middle Carboniferous age, intruded
by sills of quartz monzonite porphyry, the ore bodies
occurring in a fault zone in the limestone. The copper ores
comprise mainly chrysocolla and malachite, and contain traces
only of platinum. The gold ore occurs in a fine-grained
siliceous matrix, containing a bismuth-bearing variety of
<i>plumbo-jarosite</i> (a hydrous sulphate of iron and lead). The
rare metals are present in the free state, being apparently
alloys of gold, platinum and palladium<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1919 the Boss Mine shipped $22,365 worth of platinum-bearing
ore<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a>. A plant of 300 tons monthly capacity has
recently been erected at Los Angeles, California, for the
treatment of its complex ores, which average 7 per cent. of
copper, 4 per cent. bismuth, and 1·0 oz. of platinum and
palladium, 0·75 oz. of gold, and 3 oz. of silver per ton. The
pulp from ore pulverized to 80 mesh is agitated with sulphuric
acid (2 per cent.). The acid solution contains the copper
and about 20 per cent. of the platinum. The copper is precipitated
as cement copper, together with the platinum, by
means of scrap-iron. The remainder of the platinum, together
with the gold and silver, is first leached with, and then precipitated
from, a neutral solution of calcium chloride. The
inventors of the process claim that approximately 92 per cent.
of the copper, 96 per cent. of the platinum metals, gold and
silver, and over 90 per cent. of the bismuth are recovered by
this process<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Metals of the platinum group have recently been shown to
exist in small quantities in the ore of the Oro Amigo Mine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>situated between 1 and 2 miles north-east of the Boss
Mine. This ore differs from that of the Boss Mine, in that
bismuth and plumbo-jarosite are absent. According to H. K.
Riddell, the platinum metals content averages from a trace
to 0·1 oz. per ton of ore.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>North Carolina.</i>—At Mason Mountain, in Mason county,
platinum occurs associated with rhodonite, garnet, biotite and
iron sulphides in metamorphic deposits.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>New York.</i>—It was reported a few years ago that platinum
existed in large quantities in alluvial sands of the Adirondack
region. J. M. Clarke, the New York State Geologist, examined
the occurrence in 1917, and found that platinum was present
in traces only, the deposits being of no economic importance
<a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> p. 541.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Pennsylvania.</i>—At Lancaster county platinum is associated
with pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena in mica-schist, and also
at Boyertown in black Triassic shale.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Washington.</i>—The production of platinum on a small scale
has been reported from beach deposits at the mouth of the
south fork of the Lewis River near Yacolt, and also on beaches
southward from the Straits of Juan de Fuca<a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> p. 542. The
metal has also been located at various places in the Cascade
Mountains in the central part of the State.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Wyoming.</i>—Palladium and platinum, in the proportion of
3 to 1, are obtained at the Rambler Mine, in Albany county,
the metals occurring as sperrylite in copper ore, contained in
the kaolinized portion of a dunite dyke, intrusive into granite
gneiss. The ore consists of covellite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite
and tetrahedrite, with nickel and gold<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a>. It is stated that
the platinum and palladium contents vary directly with the
percentage of copper present, a typical assay giving the following
values: copper, 5 per cent.; gold, 0·02 oz.; silver, 1 oz.;
palladium, 0·4 oz.; and platinum, 0·6 oz. per ton<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Utah.</i>—Platinum and gold in very fine particles occur in the
Green River, east of Vernal; also in the Colorado River, near
Hite, below the mouth of the Green River. Attempts to mine
these deposits have so far proved unsuccessful, due largely to
the inaccessibility of the region, as well as the finely-divided

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Brazil</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>José Vieira do Couto, in 1801, first pointed out that platinum
occurs in the sands of the Lages River, near Conceiçao, Minas
Geraes. According to E. Hussak<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a>, platinum in that
region occurs only in the alluvium of rivers having their rise
on the eastern slope of the Serra do Espinhaço. The platinum
is accompanied by black pebbles of quartz-tourmaline rocks,
magnetite, hematite, rutile, octahedrite, xenotime, monazite,
senaite, pseudomorphs of rutile after octahedrite (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">captivos</span></i>),
zircon and gold, which is sometimes of a copper-red colour
(palladium-gold). Palladic gold was formerly called <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">ouro
branco</span></i> (white gold), by the miners.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Condado, further north on the eastern slope of the same
Serra, platinum also occurs with very similar associations.
The platinum from both localities occurs in bunchy, mammillated
and globular forms, concave within, with thin walls,
having a radiated fibrous structure under the microscope. It
is frequently in thin foliated crusts, having the characteristic
structure of hematite. It was accurately described by
Wollaston in 1805 and 1809. Hussak thinks the primary
formation was an olivine rock, or gabbro, while the platinum
is secondary, having been most probably re-deposited from
solutions resulting from the decomposition of platiniferous
pyrites or of sperrylite (PtAs<sub>2</sub>), minerals derived, possibly,
from the neighbouring schistose quartzite, or from the overlying
conglomeratic quartzite.</p>

<p class='c007'>The platinum of Condado, although comparable, as regards
density, to the Russian platinum, is very rich in palladium, is
non-magnetic and contains practically no iron. An analysis
by G. Florence gave the following percentages: insoluble
residue, 0·92; platinum, 73·99; iridium, 0·08; palladium, 21·77;
iron, 0·10 (= 96·86), undetermined (rhodium and osmium), 3·14.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Rio Abaeté, Minas Geraes, platinum—very different
in appearance and chemical composition from that of the
Serra do Espinhaço—occurs in placer deposits, associated with
gold, diamonds and the following minerals: rolled pieces of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>hydro-phosphate of barium and aluminium (<i>gorceixite</i> =
“marumbé” of miners), garnet, almandite, pyrope, ashy-blue
oxide of titanium (<i>bagageira</i>—regarded as a good indicator for
diamonds), magnetite, chromite and calcium-titanate (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">perovskite</span></i>).
Pyroxene-olivine rock, a typical picrite-porphyry, rich
in perovskite, and granular magnetite rocks, rich in titanium,
have been observed by Oliveira in the vicinity. Hence it is
highly probable that the platinum, as in the Urals, came from
olivine rocks. The platinum occurs in thin laminæ, strongly
rolled, and, rarely, in cubical crystals with the edges visibly
rounded. It is strongly magnetic and contains no palladium.
Minute crystals of osmiridium may occur with those of platinum,
and in the platinum particles are found regular inclusions of
osmiridium, as at Nizhne Turinsk, in the Urals, the platinum
of which locality it resembles in chemical composition, magnetic
properties and crystalline structure. The following analysis
shows the percentage and composition of a general sample:
insoluble residue, 7·57; iron, 9·62; palladium, trace; copper,
trace; platinum metals, 82·81.</p>

<p class='c007'>The auriferous alluvial of the Cuyabá and Coxim rivers in
the southern part of the State of Matto-Grosso, also contain
some platinum. According to Luiz Caetano Ferraz<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a>,
platinum occurs in the River Coxipó-Mirim, where golddredging
is carried on, combined with palladium, iron, osmium
and iridium in small spherical grains, flattened on one side, of
a brilliant white colour and strongly magnetic. It is found in
alluvial deposits, associated with various kinds of quartz and
oxides of iron, marcasite, arsenopyrite, rutile, anatase, almandine,
garnet, black tourmaline, monazite, staurolite, white
topaz, sphene, cassiterite, wolfram, graphite, galena and native
silver.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the State of Bahia, platinum has been found in Ituassú,
Feira de S. Anna and Serra do Assuruá, and it is said to
occur at Sâo Bartholomeu, and in the Serras do Pitango and
Macahubes<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum also occurs in Brazil as rare disseminations in the
gold-bearing <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">jacutinga</span></i>, intercalated in the itabirites (e.g. at
Gongo Socco Mine, long since abandoned). The jacutinga
occurs as narrow bands and nuclei in the itabirites, containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a high percentage of gold, with much talc, clay and pulverulent
pyrolusite. As accessory minerals zircon, rutile, cassiterite
and tourmaline occur. Hussak thinks that the gold-bearing
jacutinga has been derived from altered pegmatite veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>From analyses made by Johnson (1833–41) on the Gongo
Socco bullion, it would appear that the percentages of silver
and platinum decreased while those of copper and palladium
increased with depth (Henwood). The percentages of palladium
varied from 3·89 to 4·80, and that of platinum from
0·04 to 0·12.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Candonga, gold occurs in an eruptive rock rich in
magnetite enclosed in itabirite, and is probably of contact-metamorphic
origin. The gold occurs in grains of high standard,
and with it are found fine indented scales of palladic gold, of a
bright copper-red colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Itabira do Matto Dentro gold occurs in jacutinga, lying
between a micaceous iron schist, rich in quartz, and an enormous
solid bed of itabirite. The palladium-gold may be copper-red,
dark-brown or silver-white in colour. Native platinum also
occurs with the gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grains of platinum have also been found in the most
northerly of the auriferous lenticular masses, which occur near
the Bruscus River, near Pernambuco, in Cambrian crystalline
schists. The matrix is a coarse white quartz containing small
quantities of the arsenides and sulphides of iron, and the
sulphides of copper, lead and zinc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum, although widely distributed in Brazil, occurs in
such small quantities that so far there has been no production;
but in the near future richer and more extensive deposits may
be discovered, or it may be found practicable to win the metal
from those already known, as an important by-product.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palladium-gold, or <i>porpezite</i>, is a natural alloy of palladium
and gold, and may contain up to 10 per cent. of the former
metal. It is found in Brazil, in gold-washings, and also in
the gold-bearing jacutinga reefs at Gongo Socco, Candonga
and Itabira do Matto Dentro. In 1870 Henwood showed
that the palladic gold from Gongo Socco contained, to a
moderate depth from surface, from 0·04 to 0·12 per cent. of
platinum. (Palladium-gold has also been reported from gold-washings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in the Caucasus, near Batoum.) Ruer concludes,
from an examination of the freezing-point curves of artificial
alloys of gold and palladium, that these alloys form a continuous
series of mixed crystals, and that there is no indication
of chemical combinations<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Colombia</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>This republic is the second largest producer of platinum
in the world, and in pre-war years supplied about 5 per cent.
of the world’s total output. Owing to the decline of the
Russian supply, and the increased demand for the metal, the
industry has in recent years received a considerable stimulus,
and in 1916 Colombia’s production rose to approximately one-third
of the Russian output.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platinum was first introduced into Europe from Colombia
in 1735, although the metal was known in America for some
time previously<a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> p. 608. In 1810 the value of platinum
stood at $5 to $6 (U.S.) per oz., and in 1823 the price had further
dropped to from $3 to $4 per oz. As a result, platinum was
rejected as waste in the operation of refining gold by the
“dry-blowing” system. Later, when platinum became valuable,
much of this dumped metal was recovered, notably in
Quibdo, the capital of the Chocó district, where much gold-refining
was carried on.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The crude platinum is estimated at 84 to 85 per cent. fine.
The price in 1917 fluctuated from £16 to £20 10<i>s.</i> per oz., the
average for the year being nearer the latter amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>During 1918 the United States Government fixed the price
at $105 per oz., which stimulated production.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deposits are alluvial, and consist of re-concentrates of
older gravels. The principal source of supply is at the head
of the San Juan River, which enters the Pacific Ocean north
of Buenaventura, the richest deposits occurring in the Condoto,
Opagado and Tamanal Rivers, tributaries of the San Juan<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a>.
Platinum is also obtained in the Upper Atrato River,
which flows northward to the Caribbean Sea. It is nearly
always found associated with gold. In the gravels of the
San Juan River the two metals are present in about equal
proportions, and in those of the Atrato the ratio is approximately
85 of gold to 15 of platinum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The area including the watersheds of the San Juan and
Upper Atrato Rivers is known as the Chocó district. T.
Ospina, Director of the Colombian School of Mines<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a>, estimates
that in the area are 5,000 sq. miles of gold and
platinum deposits, the Mira River forming the southern
boundary of the area. In 1916 he estimated that there were
in it 68,000,000 c. yd. of actually profitable gravel, with
a reserve of 336,000,000 yd. of possibly profitable ground.
Platinum has also been recovered in much smaller amounts
on the Micay River in the Barbacoas district, near the frontier
of Ecuador. The stream beds in which platinum occurs are
those in which Tertiary conglomerates have become eroded;
the river gravels about the areas underlain by that formation
are barren. The conglomerates are composed of rounded
boulders of basic rocks, such as diabase, melaphyre, peridotite
and dunite<a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> p. 620.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Novita Vieja, in the centre of the Chocó district, a bed
of conglomerate 6 to 12 ft. thick has been laid bare, over an
area 2½ miles long and ½ mile wide, through the sluicing away
of the overlying sands. It contains 0·5 oz. of gold, and
0·5 oz. of platinum, per ton<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a>. According to Castillo, the
parent rock is a typical gabbro, pyroxene predominating over
the felspar<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a> p. 826.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Platinum has been found in the Chocó district in serpentine
rock. Granite also occurs in the same district, traversed
by quartz lodes containing palladium, iridium, osmium and
rhodium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colombian crude platinum contains from 80 to 85 per cent.
platinum, the remaining 15 to 20 per cent. consisting chiefly
of iridium and osmium. The sands in which it occurs are
described as brown in colour, and carrying, besides platinum
and gold, the heavy minerals chromite, magnetite and ilmenite

<p class='c007'>In the past, mining operations have been very irregularly
carried on, by primitive methods of working, but dredges are
now being employed in increasing numbers. In 1915 a dredge
was operated on the Condoto River, in the province of Chocó,
by the Anglo-Colombian Development Company, and showed
good results. Native methods of working are very simple.
The alluvial gravels derived from dried-up beds of ancient
rivers are hand-washed with the use of the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">batea</span></i> or dish.
Where the metal occurs in the bed of a river it is obtained by
diving girls, who work down to the platiniferous gravels,
removing the gravel in small dishes, the men being employed
in washing the gravels on the river banks<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a>. About 90 per

<p class='c007'>The question of transporting platinum concentrate to the
coast is not a matter of much difficulty, as the Atrato River
is navigable as far as Quibdo, and the San Juan can be ascended
by vessels of moderate draught for over 140 miles inland.</p>

<p class='c007'>An estimate of average working costs appears to be 6<i>d.</i> per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>c. yd. for dredging, and 3<i>d.</i> for hydraulicking<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a>. In 1917
new platiniferous deposits were discovered in the Caceres
district, between the Cauca and Nechi Rivers, in the department
of Antioquia. The mineralized area extends along the
Caceri River, a distance of 14¼ miles, the width at the north
end being 1¼ miles, and 300 ft. at the southern extremity

<p class='c015'>Platinum occurs, in association with the gold obtained from
steam gravels, in the area covered by the Rivers Bogota,
Cachabi, Uimbi, Santiago and Cayapas, but it has not so far
been found in sufficient quantities to be of economic importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dredging has been employed in mining these deposits, but
does not appear to have been a success, and operations are now
largely confined to native washings<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a>.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&trade;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&mdash;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&trade; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&trade;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&trade; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; License.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&trade; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>

        You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&trade;
        works.
    </li>

    <li style='display: list-item;'>
        You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&trade; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
